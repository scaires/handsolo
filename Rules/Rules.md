# Hand Solo Game Rules v0.1.1

## Thematic Overview

## Components & Setup

### Components

* 31 cards
	* 18 Encounter cards
	* 6 Ship cards
	* 4 Upgrade cards
	* 1 Credits tracker card
	* 1 Career tracker card
* 	1 Loan tracker card

### Setup

* Shuffle the Encounter cards together, with the starting sides face up. The side with a title without a black border is the starting side and the side with a black bordered title is the advanced side.
* Take the "shuttle" ship card and place it in front of you. Rotate it so the topmost side is not "illegal" or "damaged" (a legal, undamaged shuttle).
* Set aside the other 5 ship cards and the 4 modification cards.
* Set the career track to 1 year and the credits track to 10 credits using a paperclip or other marker. Rotate the loan tracker card to the "no loans" side. Place the trackers near you.

#### Playing on a table

* Place the Encounter deck face-up on the table.
* Place the career, credits, and loan tracker nearby.
* Place your ship nearby.
* Leave room nearby for the Encounter discard.
* When you reveal Encounter cards for combat or trading, splay them at the top of the deck to reveal the goods or combat scores.
* Rotate the Encounter cards for cargo or missions and place them near or under your ship card.

#### Playing in your hand

* Pick up the Encounter deck with the starting side face up. Place your ship card at the back of the deck, with the top "stats" peeking out over the top of the deck. 
* Hold the deck while you play.
* When you reveal Encounter cards for combat or trading, splay them to reveal the goods or combat scores.
* When you discard Encounter cards, place them behind your ship card.
* If you need to flip your ship card to its damaged or illegal side, maintain its position in front of any discarded cards.
* When you take cargo or missions, stick them in the back of the discard, skewing or rotating them so the cargo or mission are visible.
* The year ends when your ship card is the topmost card in the deck.
* Place upgrade cards behind your ship card so the upgrade is visible. You may wish to attach them together with a paperclip.
* Keep the trackers, ship cards and upgrade cards set aside until you need them (eg: on your lap, in a pocket, on a nearby surface, in the box).
