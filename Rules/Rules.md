# Hand Solo Game Rules v0.1.4

## Thematic Overview

You are the captain of a ship – your ship – which you finally scraped enough cash to purchase. Your goal now is to make your mark on the system and retire at the end of your career with cash and notoriety. Now the only question is will you earn your money and fame?

In Hand Solo you spend a set number of years flying about the space system you call home, picking up jobs as you might, making friends and enemies along the way. Your career path is to become as rich and well-known as you can. You can live out the roles of a trader, hauler, smuggler, bounty hunter, pirate, or mercenary.

Hand Solo is a solitaire game which can be played on a table, or just in your hands using no playing surface. It was designed originally for long train commutes where a compact and long game was desired, without the worry of battery life or need for a stable playing surface.

## Components & Setup

### Components

* 31 cards
	* 18 Encounter cards
	* 6 Ship cards
	* 4 Upgrade cards
	* 1 Credits tracker card
	* 1 Career tracker card
* 	1 Loan tracker card

### Setup

* Shuffle the Encounter cards together, with the starting sides face up. The side with a title without a black border is the starting side and the side with a black bordered title is the advanced side.
* Take the "shuttle" ship card and place it in front of you. Rotate it so the topmost side is not "illegal" or "damaged" (a legal, undamaged shuttle).
* Set aside the other 5 ship cards and the 4 modification cards.
* Set the career track to 1 year and the credits track to 10 credits using a paperclip or other marker. Rotate the loan tracker card to the "no loans" side. Place the trackers near you.

#### Playing on a table ('On Surface')

* Place the Encounter deck face-up on the table.
* Place the career, credits, and loan tracker nearby.
* Place your ship nearby.
* Leave room nearby for the Encounter discard.
* When you reveal Encounter cards for combat or trading, splay them at the top of the deck to reveal the goods or combat scores.
* Rotate the Encounter cards for cargo or contracts and place them near or under your ship card.

#### Playing in your hand ('In Space')

* Pick up the Encounter deck with the starting side face up. Place your ship card at the back of the deck, with the top "stats" peeking out over the top of the deck. 
* Hold the deck while you play.
* When you reveal Encounter cards for combat or trading, splay them to reveal the goods or combat scores.
* When you discard Encounter cards, place them behind your ship card.
* If you need to flip your ship card to its damaged or illegal side, maintain its position in front of any discarded cards.
* When you take cargo or contracts, stick them in the back of the discard, skewing or rotating them so the cargo or contract is visible.
* The year ends when your ship card is the topmost card in the deck.
* Place upgrade cards behind your ship card so the upgrade is visible. You may wish to attach them together with a paperclip.
* Keep the trackers, ship cards and upgrade cards set aside until you need them (eg: on your lap, in a pocket, on a nearby surface, in the box).

## Game Overview

Each year, you will take a series of turns, in which you reveal the next card in the Encounter deck, either a Starport or a Contact. Starports let you trade commodities, accept and complete contracts, and upgrade or replace your ship, and can be turned friendly if you complete a contract or deliver goods that are in demand. Contacts include Federation patrols looking for Illegal goods, Pirates searching for valuable cargo, and traders who will happily exchange goods with you, hoping you're not a pirate yourself. At the end of each year, you can retire or continue, but you must retire at the end of year 30! Your score is determined by multiplying your credits with your notoriety - how many contacts are hostile and how many starports are friendly!

## Outline of game structure

* Reveal next card in the Encounter deck
	* If it's a Contact, resolve Contact text.
	* If it's a Starport, decide to land or bypass.
* Discard all revealed cards
* If there are no more cards, the year ends
* At the end of the year, you may choose to retire, or be forced to retire.

	* If there aren't enough cards to reveal because you've reached the end of the deck, reveal as many as possible.
2. Sell goods

	* After selling, you may buy all goods you wish to buy. (See: Buying goods)

	* Market size 2: reveal 2 cards.
	* Market size 3: reveal 3 cards.
* Economy type
	* The starport's economy type summarizes which goods are plentiful, with low prices, and which goods are scarce, with high prices. 

### Revealing market cards

* "Splay" the starport card to the right so that only the leftmost portion of the card underneath is showing, revealing the commodity information but not the rest of the card. Continue revealing the card under that one until you have revealed all market cards.

### Prices
* Base price
	* Each commodity's base price is shown in the market section of the Starport card.
* Demand arrow
	* The demand arrow shows if a price is higher than average (up arrow), lower than average (down arrow), or average (no arrow). 
* Market modifiers
<<<<<<< HEAD
    * The lower left box on revealed market cards may show a market modifier: The listed good's price is increased or decreased by the amount shown. Note: The market modifier is always ignored on the Starport card itself. Note: a good's price is always at a minimum of '1'.

### Commodities

#### Valuable commodities

* Valuable commodities are seized by pirates when pirate contacts are encountered.

#### Illegal commodities

* Illegal commodities are seized by federation ships when federation contacts are encountered.

#### Advanced commodities
* Advanced commodities have a "plus" sign after their abbreviaton. Advanced commodities buy and sell at the price of their corresponding basic good unless the advanced commodity has a price listed at the Starport market.

### Buying commodities
* Place the good card in the designated area for cargo. For example, rotate it 90 degrees to the right and tuck it at the back of the deck (in-hand) or behind your ship card (on-surface). Pay the cost in credits of the commodity You are buying (see: commodity prices). You may not buy a commodity if your cargo hold is full (if you have as many units of cargo as your cargo stat).
* If you wish to buy goods, buying goods must be the last action you take at the starport.
* To buy goods, first calculate the prices of all goods you wish to buy, including modifiers. For each good card you wish to buy, decrease your credits by that amount. If you do not have enough credits, you may not buy the good. Add the good to your ship. (Eg: by rotating and tucking it in the rear of the deck. Needs more detail). 
* You may only each good card once.

### Selling commodities
* You must sell all goods you wish to sell before you can buy goods.
* To sell a good card, determine the price (see: Prices), discard the good card, and increase your credits by the sell price.

### Discarding cargo

* You may discard goods freely at any time without penalty

### Good in demand

* Each starport has a good that is in demand. If you sell the listed number of cards of the good in demand, the starport becomes friendly to you.

### Affinity
* All starports have an affinity towards you, either Neutral or Friendly. All starports begin the game Neutral. Friendly starports have more favorable prices for goods, and also make advanced goods available.

## Card manipulation and information
* Unless changing affinity, never change which side of an encounter card is face up (eg when taking, discarding, etc)
* When splaying cards, if possible, do not reveal more of the card than needed to splay. This avoids the situation where you can use the knowledge of what the card is to influence your decisions. (If you end up memorizing the cards, that's fine, but try not to let it influence you).
* It is up to you whether you will allow yourself to go through the discard to see which cards have already been played. Some people prefer to play this way to decrease the memory and random element, and some prefer to keep the discard hidden for challenge or thematic reasons.

## Contacts

### Encountering a Contact

* Resolve the contact's encounter text.
* Discard the contact card once it is resolved.

### Affinity
* All contacts are Neutral for this version of the game. 

### Pirates

#### Pirate Hunter

* When you encounter a Pirate Hunter, you must discard all valuable cargo.

### Federation

#### Federation Enforcer

* When you encounter a Federation Enforcer, you must discard all illegal cargo and pay the listed fine.

### Merchants

#### Courier/Smuggler/Trader/Freighter/Bulk Trader

* When you encounter a Merchant, you may buy or sell one card of the listed good for the listed price per unit.
